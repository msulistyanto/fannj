Instructions on how to get FannJ working in Microsoft Windows.

FANN (http://leenissen.dk/fann) has pre-built Windows DLLs for FANN version 2.0.0.
However, FannJ was built and tested on 2.1.0beta.  If you want 2.1.0beta DLLs, you will have to build them.  See FANN documentation for help with this.  FannJ _should_ run on FANN version 2.0.0.  If you have problems please file an issue.

= Instructions =
== Step 1 : Install FANN Library ==

  * Visit the Downloads section of the FANN website and download fann-win-dll-2.0.0.zip.  
  * Unzip the file and locate _fann-2.0.0/Microsoft/WindowsDLL/bin/fannfixed.dll_.  
  * Note: This file is also available as a download from the FannJ project site.  
  * Copy _fannfixed.dll_ to _windows\system32\_

TODO: what is the prefered method of installing a DLL in Windows?

  * Alternatively, build and install the 2.1.0beta DLLs from the FANN source.

== Step 2 : Install FANN GUI Tools ==

I have had good luck with `FannTool` http://code.google.com/p/fanntool

Download and install using their instructions.

== Step 3 : Create Train and Test your ANN ==

Use the `FannTool` to create, train, and test your ANN.  The training and test file formats are defined in the FANN documentation.  Save the ANN when you are happy with it.

== Step 4 : Configure Java Project ==

Using the latest version of the FannJ jar in your Java project, open the ANN file saved using `FannTool` and run it.
